# Caesars_cipher
Breaking the Caesar's cipher from a given text

This project is constructed as a user-friendly interface application, which uses multiple functions to 
break the Caesar's cipher and to do other operation related to this topic, letting the user to chose from the options.

For the documentation and other explanations, look in the caesars_cipher file.

This project is very useful because we can see how a generated text can be translated in the English language, by the frequency of the letters in the English alphabet.


To run this project, you can download the archive/clone the repository. The main.cpp and the distribution.txt files are important to be included and you should run the main.cpp in Visual Studio Community or any other IDE.
(please input only a part of the example cipher - 10 words or something like that - because the string which contains the cipher has a certain maximum capacity)
